# StaticMovementRouter

Static Movement Router (SMR) is a map routing application with a CLI front-end. It was designed for the purpose of easily navigating towns in driving/truck simulators such as Rigs of Rods. It has no ability to track the position of the user in the game, so navigation is performed by inputting a start and an end location.
